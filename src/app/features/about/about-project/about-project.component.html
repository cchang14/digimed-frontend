<h2>About Project</h2>
<p>
    The DigiMed Repository is a curated resource that makes research data discoverable, freely reusable, and citable. Dryad provides a general-purpose home for a wide diversity of data types.<br/>
    DigiMed originated from an initiative among a group of leading journals and scientific societies to adopt a joint data archiving policy (JDAP) for their publications, and the recognition that open, easy-to-use, not-for-profit, community-governed data infrastructure was needed to support such a policy. These remain our guiding principles.<br/>
    DigiMed's vision is to promote a world where research data is openly available, integrated with the scholarly literature, and routinely re-used to create knowledge.<br/>
    Our mission is to provide the infrastructure for, and promote the re-use of, data underlying the scholarly literature.<br/>
