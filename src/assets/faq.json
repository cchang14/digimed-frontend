        "answer": "Files can be uploaded from your local computer or from the cloud or remote servers via a URL. Up to 300GB can be uploaded per DOI. When using a URL, Google Drive links do not work, so please choose another mechanism. If using links from GitHub, link to the individual files rather than the repository as a whole. To confirm that files have uploaded successfully, check that all files have a size greater than 0 B."
